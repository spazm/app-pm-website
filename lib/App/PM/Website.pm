=head1 DESCRIPTION

Use C<pm-website> to render and maintain an up-to-date info page
for your Perl Monger group!

L<PM.org|http://pm.org> provides free hosting for perl monger groups.
Pages must be updated with webDAV and server-side scripts are not
allowed.  C<pm-website> will update and install a static, template-driven
page via webDAV with minimal effort.  Spend less time while creating a
more useful front page.  Everyone wins!

=head1 COMMANDS

=over

=item C<pm-website init>

Initialize a configuration yaml file with the necessary keys

=item C<pm-website build>

Builds the index file (F<website/index.html>) by rendering the
template (F<template/index.in>) with TemplateToolkit. The template
is passed models describing the next meeting and location, past
meetings, presenters and locations. See L</Model>.

=item C<pm-website install>

Uploads F<website/index.html> via webDAV to F<< groups.pm.org/groups/I<$groupname> >>, which corresponds to L<< http://I<$groupname>.pm.org/ >>

I<username> and I<groupname> are read from the configuration file
and password is read from the C<groups.pm.org> entry in F<$HOME/.netrc>
if the files exists and is not readable by others.

    #netrc example
    machine  groups.pm.org
    login    USERNAME
    password PASSWORD

=head1 Model

The template will be provided with models derived from the configuration file.  Any information added to the presenter, location and meetings configuration keys will be presented in the model.

=over

=item C<m>

A hash describing the next meeting.

Meetings have additional date keys added from the C<event_date> or C<epoch> field.

=over

=item * C<epoch>

event time in epoch unix seconds.  Created from C<event_date> if missing.

=item * C<dt>

a DateTime object created from C<epoch>

=item * C<ds1>

C<dt> rendered using strp pattern '%Y-%b-%d'.

=item * C<ds_std>

C<dt> rendered using strp pattern '%A %B %e, %Y'.

=item * C<event_date_pretty>

C<dt> rendered using strp pattern '%A the %e' and then munged by Lingua::EN::Numbers::Ordinate to produce strings like "Friday the 13th" or "Thursday the 23rd"

=back

=item C<meetings>

An array of hashes describing past meetings.  The array is reverse sorted by meeting start date. Each hash describes a meeting.  The next meeting C<m> is not included in the list of meetings.
