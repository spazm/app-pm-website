        title: Perl::Critic
        abstract: "Perl::Critic is the leading static analyzer for Perl.  Software development teams (large and small) use Perl::Critic every day to automatically find bugs, manage complexity, and enforce consistency in their Perl source code.  My presentation will demonstrate how to use, configure, and extend Perl::Critic.  I'll also show how to automate and integrate Perl::Critic into your development cycle.  Perl::Critic is available on CPAN here: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic"

        title: AnyEvent -- Perl Asynchronous Programming
        abstract: Event driven programming has been a powerful paradigm for years, but it's emerging as an increasingly important way to work. Making events easy is part of what has made node.js so exciting, and is possible in Python with Eventlet and Ruby with EventMachine. Perl's answer to this is very mature and flexible: AnyEvent. As well as an introduction to the module, how to use it, and some of the other modules in the "family", we'll cover some before/after examples of synchronous code made asynchronous.
      - presenter: gabec
        title: Epistemology & Perl Oracles
        abstract: Most of us are familiar with the output of Perl's native test oracle every time we install a module from CPAN, ok, not ok.  When testing, did you ever think that you might need to know more than that to isolate faults?  This discussion covers the Test Anything Protocol (TAP), capturing system events & using Perl to lean more what you know & what you don't know about the application you are testing.
